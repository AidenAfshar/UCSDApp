Another aspect of the same ambiguity: radical change depends on a mass basis, but every step in the struggle for radical change isolates the opposition from the masses and provokes intensified repression: mobilization of institutionalized violence against the opposition, thus further diminishing the prospects for radical change.” 	Marcuse, Herbert.

It is the next step which is at present so mysterious: the formation from the soup of a primitive, chemical, self-reproducing system.  Even if this did happen we do not know how likely it is for the long process of evolution to culminate in a higher civilization, nor exactly how much time this might take, nor whether such creatures would really explore the universe nor how far they would succeed in traveling.” 	Crick, Francis.

Generally at this level approximations take us away from theory and each step away from theory moves closer towards the truth. I illustrate with two examples from the joint paper with Jon Nordby.” 	Cartwright, Nancy. How the Laws of Physics Lie.

      53	NOW	CRADLE OF OUR COMMON EARTHLY EXPERIENCE THE COSMIC PAGEANT NOW FAMILIAR THE MAGNITUDES BOTH LARGE AND SMALL FOR BOTH SPACE AND TIME WE	Crick, Francis	“We must calculate and recalculate, even though only approximately, to check and recheck our initial impressions until slowly, with time and constant application, the real world, the world of the immensely small and the immensely great, becomes as familiar to us as the simple cradle of our common earthly experience.  The Cosmic Pageant. Now that we have become familiar with the magnitudes involved, both large and small, for both space and time, we must sketch what we know of the origin of the universe, together with the formation of the galaxies and the stars and finally of the planets which make up our solar system, so that we can outline the conditions under which life originated, either on earth or elsewhere in the cosmos.”  	Crick, Francis.

The human animal becomes quite tough with a little practice, and can live for some years on much less than the 1900 standard of living if it believes that it must do so for survival or other reasons which it holds dear.”	Urey, Harold C.

The more the worker expends himself in the work the more powerful becomes the world of objects which he creates in fact of himself, the poorer he becomes in his inner life, and the less he belongs to himself.

The end of Song of Myself, the moral object which synchronizes with its poetic object, is to know that the world is there, and in the knowing, to know itself as there; in effect, through such a transaction to create itself and the possibility for readers to create themselves.” 	Pearce, Roy Harvey.

By offering to all the mediators the being that was previously captive in Nature and in Society, the passage of time becomes more comprehensible again. In the world of the Copernican Revolution, in which everything had to be contained between the poles of Nature and Society, history did not really count.”	Latour, Bruno.

      67	BECOMES	OF HUMANS THE ASYMMETRY BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE THEN BECOMES AN ASYMMETRY BETWEEN PAST AND FUTURE THE CONFUSION OF THINGS AND 	Latour, Bruno	“It is a projection of the Middle Kingdom on to a line transformed into an arrow by the brutal separation between what has no history but emerges nevertheless in history – the things of nature – and what never leaves history – the labours and passions of humans. The asymmetry between nature and culture then becomes an asymmetry between past and future. The past was the confusion of things and men; the future is what will no longer confuse them.” 	Latour, Bruno. We Have Never Been Modern, trans. Catherine Porter.

The ‘consciousness of something’ becomes nothing more than a slender footbridge spanning a gradually widening abyss. Phenomenologists had to cave in – and they did.”	Latour, Bruno.

The thin film of writing becomes a movement of strata, a play of spaces. A different world (the reader's) slips into the author's place.  This mutation makes the text habitable, like a rented apartment. It transforms another person's property into a space borrowed for a moment by a transient.” 	Certeau, Michel de.

At the first coming in of these winds they blow but faintly; but then the tornadoes rise one in a day, sometimes two. These are thunder-showers which commonly come against the wind, bringing with them a contrary wind to what did blow before. After the tornadoes are over the wind shifts about again and the sky becomes clear, yet then in the valleys and the sides of the mountains there rises thick fog which covers the land.” 	Dampier, William, and Nicholas Thomas.

"A search of smaller scope is made in a paired-associate task; when the set of possible responses is large, the search for the answer is similar to that made in free recall, with a search component and a recognition component to identify the recovered trace as the appropriate one. When the set of responses in a paired-associate task is quite small, the task becomes one of recognition alone: the subject can generate each possible response in order and perform a recognition test on each. The recognition test presumably probes the trace for information identifying it as being from the correct list and being associated with the correct stimulus."	Atkinson, Richard C., J. W.

According to my view the problem of why the particles of living material get together as they do to make bodies of the shape we see everywhere among plants and animals, is a problem of the same class though of vastly greater complexity, as that of why the particles of water get together to make crystals of the many shapes in which ice crystals occur.” 	Ritter, William Emerson.

I know, for instance, that even in a small group, like a family, we all want to read one book at the same time, and we all want to tear each other's hair out when we can't get a copy.

C.	“A list of 16 words was read in a random order over and over again until the subject had learned all the words in the list. After each reading of the list the subject would write down all the words he could remember. Each reading of the list was in a new random order; nevertheless the subjects tended to organize their recall in a similar fashion from trial to trial. This clearly contradicts the hypothesis that the subject searches through memory in a random fashion after each reading.”	Atkinson, R. C., and R. M. Shiffrin.

Max follows the piano metaphor also in that objects do not specify what they wait for, but rather objects explicitly choose which other objects to trigger. In other words, the choice is up to the triggering object, not the triggered one (the player, not the piano).” 	Puckette, Miller. "Max at Seventeen."

The uniform dark pigmentation of fishes in the lightless depths, as contrasted with the ventral-dorsal differentiation of those inhabiting the lighted zone, indicates that the direction of light is significant in the distribution of pigment.”	Sverdrup, H.

The wealth and the technology around us tells us that a free, humane, harmonious society lies very near.

Let the joy of victory be the foundation of an undying vow; a renewed commitment to the cause of freedom. For we know now that victories are possible, though the struggles they demand are long and arduous.

At the horizon, where my line of Sight touches the edge of the great globe itself, I watch ships slowly disappear, first the hulls and then the tall masts, bound on voyages to un known ports 10,000 miles away. From beyond the horizon come the waves that break rhythmically on the beach, sound ing now loud, now soft, as they did long before I was born and as they will in the far future.

The Kumeyaay knew this, creating and using fire to increase the abundance of edible plants for humans and wildlife, for controlling insects and diseases that could harm edible and useful plants, and to increase plant materials used in making baskets, cordage, clothing, and tools. Fire was also used purposefully to remove dead materials and to promote plant growth and recycling of nutrients.” 	Connolly Miskwish, Michael, Stan Rodriguez, and Martha Rodriguez.

This greatly increased the authority of the elected governments of the Reservations and limited the authority of the federal agencies to direct resources.  Tribes began to explore alternatives beyond the programs of the federal government and entered into energy resource development, timber management, fisheries development, tourism, farming and gaming.

Precipitation has gradually declined over the last 10,000 years, as the climate has warmed. The short-term wet-drought cycles that are inherent in the system make it difficult to quantify the amount of drought directly attributable to human activity. However, the growing evidence seems to indicate that most of present day warming is man-made.”	Connolly Miskwish, Michael. Watersheds of the Southern Coast.

Rainfall and snow melt provide recharge into the aquifer basins that are followed by the gradual release of stored water over the dryer months of the year. In some areas, the storage in the unconsolidated granites characteristic of the coast ranges can release water at the slow rate of less than one foot per day.”	 Connolly Miskwish, Michael.

The nights long and starless, daytime brief, gloomy, the sun rarely out, and then only to make a cameo appearance before it vanished.” 	Hosseini, Khaled. And the Mountains Echoed. London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2013. p.22. 	https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/and-the-mountains-echoed-9781408842423/  	https://search-library.ucsd.edu/permalink/01UCS_SDI/ld412s/alma9912311512706531
      1300	NIGHTS	WAS SIGNALING ONE NIGHT DIFFERS FROM ALL OTHER NIGHTS THROUGH THEIR DEPLOYMENT OF SYNONYMS CRAFT	Armantrout, Rae	“Evening succeeds evening.   Demons discourse on familiar topics.  They describe a wraith’s response to a description.  ‘I think he was signaling.’  One night differs from all other nights  Through their deployment of synonyms.  ‘Craft a way forward.’  ‘Get out ahead of this with his plan.’” 	Armantrout, Rae. Versed. Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 2010. p. 48. 		https://search-library.ucsd.edu/permalink/01UCS_SDI/ld412s/alma991004137869706535

Thoughts Are things. Thoughtless streets  Pass nights outdoors. Syllables Aim to spread out, But hardly do.” 	Perelman, Bob. “Wishes.” Primer.

      1303	NIGHTS	HEIGHT AND TIME AND PLACE ARE LOST WHERE ELDEST NIGHTS AND CHAOS ANCESTORS HOLD ETERNAL ANARCHY	Ritter, William Emerson	“...and when there existed, ‘...a dark Illimitable ocean, without bound, without dimension, where length, breadth, and height, and time and place were lost; where eldest night and Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold Eternal anarchy.’ Even the less exuberantly fanciful Chaos of Hesiod held to be a ‘yawning abyss composed of Void, Mass, and Darkness,’ could hardly appeal to the curbed and guided imagination of present-day science.” 	Ritter, William Emerson.

      1304	NIGHTS	FROST-STARS LIKE THE SKY THE SUBLIME DARKNESS OF STORM NIGHTS WHEN ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT THE CLOUDS IN WHOSE	Muir, John	“...while the meadows at their feet sparkle with frost-stars like the sky; the sublime darkness of storm-nights, when all the lights are out; the clouds whose depths the frail snow-flowers grow; the behavior and many voices of the different kind of storms, trees, birds, waterfalls, and snow avalanches in the ever-changing weather.” 	Muir, John.

      1305	NIGHTS	SUMMER'S TROPICAL SUN THE BLUE SKY THE APPROACHING NIGHTS AND THE MORNINGS THE SUN THE STARS THE GRASS	Ritter, William Emerson	“The bit of earth upon which I press my feet here and now and the larger earth that yields me food and drink , this ocean with its relentless power when goaded by winter storms, and with its heavenly peace and calm in its middle stretches under the summer's tropical sun, the blue sky, the approaching night , and the night and the morning, the sun, the stars, the milky way, the grass, the trees, my animal companions, the wild birds, the barn-yard fowls, my dogs, the cattle, the horse, and above all my human friends , my colleagues in work, and my family -- all these have for me a reality that no disorder or dimness of mind (unless indeed , these go to the point of swoon or delirium) or no speculative sophistication can strip them of.”	Ritter, William Emerson.
